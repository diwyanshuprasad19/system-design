What Is Sliding Window Counter?
A rate limiting algorithm that splits a time window (like 1 hour) into multiple smaller buckets (like 60 1-min blocks).
It then:

Stores counts (not timestamps!) per bucket

When a request comes, it adds up the counts from the relevant buckets (like last 60 mins)

If total < limit → ✅ allow

Otherwise → ❌ deny

🧠 Layman Explanation
Imagine a whiteboard with 60 boxes, each for a minute in the past hour.
Every time someone makes a request:

You put a tally mark in the current box.

When the clock ticks, you shift focus to the next box.

The algorithm adds all 60 boxes → decides whether to allow another request.

Current Time: 2:50 PM
Sliding Window: 2:50 → 3:50
1-Min Buckets:
  [2:50-2:51] = 5
  [2:49-2:50] = 3
  [2:48-2:49] = 0
  ...
  Total in last hour = 60 → ✅ Request allowed
🧪 Real-Time Use Case:
Limit: 100 requests/hour

Sub-window (bucket): 1 minute

Per-minute limit: 5 requests

using namespace std;

    long long getCurrentMinute() {

        buckets[nowMinute]++;
        return true;

int main() {
    SlidingWindowCounter limiter(100, 5); // 100 req/hour, 5 req/min

    for (int i = 1; i <= 120; i++) {

⚙️ Efficiency Benefits
Factor	Sliding Window Log	Sliding Window Counter
Stores each request	✅ Yes	❌ No
Stores per-minute count	❌ No	✅ Yes
Memory usage	High	Low
Ideal for production?	⚠️ Limited	✅ Yes
🧠 Summary
Feature	Value
Accurate under scale	✅ Yes
Low memory usage	✅ Yes (buckets, not full logs)
Sliding precision	✅ Yes (vs. fixed window edge burst)
Ideal use case	APIs, auth, per-user request caps



Sliding Window Log vs Sliding Window Counter
Metric	Sliding Window Log	Sliding Window Counter
What it stores	⏱️ Individual timestamps of each request	🧮 Aggregated count per time bucket (e.g., per minute)
Time complexity	O(n) per request (removing outdated timestamps)	O(1) per request (just increment & sum)
Space complexity	O(n) — stores every request individually	O(k) — only stores k buckets (e.g., 60 for hour)
Precision	✅ Very precise (to the second)	⚖️ Slightly approximate (per bucket granularity)
CPU usage	🔥 Higher at scale	🧊 Lower, predictable
Memory usage	❌ Increases with traffic	✅ Constant space (fixed # of buckets)
Ideal for	Few users, high precision	High concurrency, production-scale systems
🧠 In Simple Terms
🔹 Sliding Window Log
Acts like a scroll of paper:
Write the exact time of every request

To decide if the next request is allowed:

You scan and clean the log (remove expired timestamps)

Count how many requests remain

✅ High precision, ❌ High work per request

🧪 Time complexity: O(n)
🧪 Space complexity: O(n)
(n = number of requests in the window)

🔹 Sliding Window Counter
Acts like a whiteboard with 60 boxes

Each box is 1 minute

You only track how many requests in each minute

On a new request:

You clean only old buckets (e.g., anything older than 60 min)

Just sum 60 values

🧪 Time complexity: O(1) to update and check
🧪 Space complexity: O(k)
(k = number of buckets, e.g., 60 for an hour)

🧪 Real-World Example
Let’s say:

Your API gets 1 million requests per minute

You want to allow 1000 req/hour per user

With Log (per user)	With Counter (per user)
Store 1000 timestamps	Store 60 integer values
On each request: loop + count	Just sum 60 buckets
CPU = 🔥	CPU = 🧊
Now imagine 100K users concurrently →
Log system blows up 💣
Counter system runs smooth ✅

✅ TL;DR Summary
Feature	Sliding Window Log	Sliding Window Counter (✔ better)
Precision	⏱️ To the second	🧮 To the bucket (e.g., 1 min)
Memory cost per user	❌ Unbounded	✅ Fixed (e.g., 60 ints per user)
Time to evaluate per request	❌ O(n)	✅ O(1)
Performance at scale	❌ Poor for 100K users	✅ Efficient
Suitable for high-throughput	❌ No	✅ Yes
🎯 When to Use Each?
Use Case	Recommendation
Low traffic, high accuracy needed	Use Sliding Log
Massive scale, real-time APIs	Use Sliding Counter ✅
Precise fraud detection (banking)	Maybe Log
Chat, search, message rate limits	Use Counter ✅
